Problem
Suppose a vector of `n` integers representing "heights" of walls, and that each index is 1 unit apart from adjacent indices. Write a function to calculate the amount of water trapped between two specific indices (water can overflow beyond the walls).
 
Explanation
wall_heights <- c(5, 1, 2, 4, 3, 2, 3)
 
 
``` {r}

water_units <- function(wall_heights, indices) {
   
   #create an empty vector to replace the wall heights
   water_heights <- c()
   
   #go along our indices to slowly build our water heights
   for (x in seq_along(wall_heights)) {
      
      #if we have already filled this index with water then skip
      #or if we have reached our second index no need to further
      #determine water heights
      if (x <= length(water_heights) || indices[2] <= length(water_heights)) {
         next
      } else if (x == 1) {
         #for our first index we just need to look right
         
         #find the next max wall height to the right, need to compare to current
         #wall height to see how much water will fill
         for (i in 2:length(wall_heights)){
            #if we reach the end then assign that as the index
            # if the current index is less than next index skip
            # if current index is greater than next index and isn't
            # the last index then assign 
            if (i == length(wall_heights)) {
               max_right_index <- i

               break
            }

      } else {
         #after the first index we need to check left and right

         for (i in x:length(wall_heights)){
